Terra is the "Ground Truth" or "Permanent Layer" of HyperDocs, built on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).


## Terra Core

These "building blocks" may prove to be useful as a distributed immutable database, beyond text documents:

- [Terra Data](./terra-data)
- [Terra Identity and Auth](./terra-identity)
- [Terra Entities](./terra-entities)
