Note: If you'd like to suggest an idea related to libp2p but not specifically related to the Go implementation, please file an issue at https://github.com/libp2p/specs instead. Even better, create a new topic on the forums (https://discuss.libp2p.io).

When requesting a _feature_, please be sure to include:
  * Your motivation. Why do you need the feature?
  * How the feature should work.

Please try to be as specific and concrete as possible.
